# Sahayta: Disaster Relief and Response Solution

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase and documentation for a disaster relief and response solution aimed at leveraging advanced technology to enhance disaster management efforts, particularly during events like floods and wildfires. The solution integrates satellite imagery analysis, drone-based victim detection, and AI-driven algorithms to improve situational awareness, resource allocation, and response coordination.

## Solution Approach
The solution approach can be summarized as follows:

1. **Satellite Imagery Analysis:** The solution utilizes satellite imagery, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, for early detection and assessment of disasters. Machine learning algorithms are employed for flood segmentation and wildfire detection, enabling rapid identification of disaster-affected areas.

2. **Drone-Based Victim Detection:** Drones equipped with high-resolution cameras are deployed for aerial imagery capture and victim detection in disaster-affected areas. Computer vision algorithms analyze drone imagery to identify and localize individuals in need of assistance, facilitating swift search and rescue operations.

3. **AI-driven Decision Support:** AI techniques are applied for data analysis and decision support, including semantic segmentation of satellite imagery,and optimization of resource allocation. These algorithms provide actionable insights to emergency responders and relief agencies, aiding in strategic planning and response coordination.

## Getting Started
To use the disaster relief and response solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/disaster-relief-solution.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries as specified in the documentation.
3. Set up the environment and configure the solution parameters according to your requirements.
4. Run the provided scripts and modules to execute the solution components, analyze data, and generate insights.
